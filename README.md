## Function introduction（功能介绍） 
```
The purpose to lose weight, one for beauty, one for health.
Obesity may affect opportunities to get a job.
Obesity may endanger mental health.
Obesity can damage your physical health.
However, lose weight is not an easy issue. For the sake of control obesity, I would like to build an application named Weight Loss Diary. It is an app that has not been built. This app can record your process to lose weight and send it to the Internet. Many people can see this process and encourage you to continue your efforts. Meanwhile, you can also see how others lose weight, and to encourage others to continue to work hard. For example, your food that eats at daily breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as what kind of exercise you take can be seen by every person. It is an app that encourage not only yourself but also others to lose weight. 
这是一个减肥APP，记录你每天减肥的过程，并把这个过程发布到互联网上，借此来获得别的减肥者的鼓励；你也可以观看别人的减肥日记，来鼓励别人。
